        Slice the 2nd line to last line, create ONE field joined with a new
        line, 

        rather than keeping the lines as part of an array. This will allow us to have ONE pipeline to process these logs regardless if they originated from containers or not.


        What happens if we don't do join and want the first to third lines?
